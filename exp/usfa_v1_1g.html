      <h2>Medieval Courting</h2>
      <p><img src="images/castles.jpeg" height="300px" ></p>
      <p>Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Approximalia there were nine princesses. They all lived in the Castle of Approximalia, each in her own room.<p>
      <p>Right next to the Kingdom of Approximalia was the County of Successorland. The Prince of Successorland was very fond of the princesses. Every day he sent his lackey to the Castle of Approximalia to deliver a package of gifts -- diamonds, chocolate, and flowers -- to one of the princesses.<p>
      <p>The trouble was, the princesses were very picky -- some preferred diamonds, some preferred chocolate, some preferred flowers, and yet others preferred all three types of gifts to varying degrees. To make matters worse, some princesses actively disliked some types of gifts.<p>
      <p>To cover his bases, the prince packaged different combinations of gifts each day. However, he left it up to his poor lackey to figure out which princess would be the happiest to receive that day’s package.<p>
      <p>In this experiment, you are the lackey. Every day, you’ll see the contents of today’s package -- some combination of diamonds, chocolate, and flowers:<p>
      <p><img src="images/new_trial_v1_1g.png" height="300px" ></p>
      <p>In this example, there are two diamonds, three chocolate bars, and one flower in the package. You cannot open the package or alter its contents; you must deliver it as is.<p>
      <p>Press the <b>space key</b> to enter the Castle of Approximalia.</p>
      <p>The castle has different rooms. Some rooms have doors which lead to other rooms:</p>
      <p><img src="images/doors_v1_1g.png" height="300px" ></p>
      <p>You can choose a door and go to the next room using the <b>number keys 1, 2, 3</b>. As a reminder, the contents of the package will be displayed in the top left corner and the door which let you in the current room will be displayed in the top right corner. Note that you can only go forward; you cannot go back to the previous room.</p>
      <p>The rest of the rooms are where the princesses live, one per room. Once you reach a room with a princess, you have to give her the package.<p>
      <p>Each princess will also tell you how much she likes or dislikes diamonds, chocolate, and flowers. This will be shown as a positive (likes) or negative (dislikes) number next to each gift type:<p>
      <p><img src="images/resources_v1_1g.png" height="300px" ></p>
      <p>This princess likes diamonds a lot (10), doesn’t like chocolate (-1), and really, really hates flowers (-15). The overall happiness of the princess for that day is the sum of the gifts weighted by how much she likes or dislikes each gift. We call this number the happiness score. In this example, the happiness score is equal to 2 diamonds x 10 + 3 chocolate bars x -1 + 1 flower x -15 = 20 - 3 - 15 = 2. <p>
      <p>Note that if the prince had put only diamonds in the package, the princess would have been much happier. Alas, the prince had his own reasons that are beyond the comprehension of the simple lackey, who dares not question his master.<p>
      <p>You can press the <b>space key</b> to deliver the package and begin the next day. The happiness score of the princess will be displayed below.<p>
      <p>Since the prince may randomly decide to visit any princess on any given day, <b>your goal is to keep the princesses as happy as possible by delivering each package to the princess that will have the highest happiness score</b>.<p>
      <p>You will always start from the same room in the castle. The castle layout will not change and the same doors will always lead to the same rooms. The princesses will always occupy the same rooms.</p>
      <p>There will be 100 days (trials) in the experiment.</p>
      <p>To encourage you to perform well, we will pay you a bonus equal to the happiness score from a randomly chosen day, converted to cents. So in the above example, you would be paid a $0.10 TODO bonus, if that day was chosen. There is no way to know in advance which day will be chosen, so do your best every time.</p>
      <p>The experiment can only be performed on a computer. Please disable any ad-blockers before starting the experiment.</p>
